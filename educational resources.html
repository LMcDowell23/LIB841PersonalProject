		<center><h1>Emersive Learning Experiences</h1></center>
		<p>
		I believe in making memorable learning experiences for students with dressing in costume, adapting personas, and doing complete room makeovers for lessons.  Below are a few of my favorite lessons which combine rigorous content, student engagement, and academic success!

				<td>ELA and Social Studies</td>
				<td>The week of Halloween I take time in my ELA classroom to do text pairing between fiction and nonfiction surrounding the holidays of Halloween and Dia De Los Muertos.  We learn about the history of both holidays and how they have spread to the United States.  We also talk about the cultures that created the holidays and why. We compare and contrast how the holiday was celebrated in the past and is celebrated today. </td>

				<td>ELA and Social Studies</td>
				<td>To introduce my immigration ELA unit I start with an activity where students are given a simple set of directions on a slip of paper.  The catch is that only two students have their directions in English!  Students become outraged when they open their papers and find that they cannot read what they have been given.  However, they soon realize that a couple of students understand what to do and start to try to mimic them…this simulates the language barrier that many immigrants experience at Ellis Island. </td>

				<td>ELA and Social Studies</td>
				<td>When the fifth grade social studies teachers are working on their Early Exploration unit I conduct a short PBL where the students use infographics and online and print nonfiction texts to create a petition for exploration to the New World.  For the end project the students present their exploration plans to the “Queen,” aka me.  They must clearly describe their crew, provisions, travel plans, and goals for their exploration. </td>
