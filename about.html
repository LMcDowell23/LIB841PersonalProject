		<center><h1>About Me</h1></center>
			<p> <strong>Education:<strong/> <br><br>
			I completed my undergraduate studies in P-5 Education at Morehead State University, where I developed a strong foundation in early childhood and elementary education. Continuing my academic journey at MSU, I earned a Master's in Educational Technology K-12, enhancing my expertise in integrating technology into the classroom. Currently, I am finalizing my Rank 1 certification through Eastern Kentucky University's School Library Media Specialist program, further expanding my skills in educational media and library science.<br><br>
			
			In the Classroom: <br><br>
			I began my teaching career in 2005 at Jones Elementary, where I was hired as a 5th grade social studies teacher. Shortly after, the school relocated across town to Mason County Intermediate School, which accommodates 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades. From 2005 to 2021, I dedicated myself to teaching at the 5th grade level, initially focusing on social studies and later transitioning to English Language Arts (ELA). Throughout my tenure, I developed a deep commitment to fostering student growth and engagement in these critical subjects. <br><br>
			
			Virtual Education: <br><br> 
			Since the 2021-2022 school year, I have been working as one of two virtual teachers for the Mason County Virtual Academy. My partner and I have built the program from the ground up, creating a robust virtual learning environment that services around 78 students in grades K-12 each year. Our enrollment is fluid and can change due to various factors such as student behavior, illness, and personal choice. This dynamic role has allowed me to adapt my teaching methods to meet the diverse needs of our students, ensuring they receive a quality education regardless of their circumstances.
