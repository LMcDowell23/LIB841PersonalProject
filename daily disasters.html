		<center><h1>Homevisit Attack</h1></center>
			<p>As with most of my homevists over the years I found myself yet again traversing the outskirts of the county looking for a home so remote that even Google Maps struggled to locate it.  Undeterred by this challenge I soldiered on and found myself at the home of the Smiths, a family known far and wide for their love of dogs—so much so that their yard resembled less of a lawn and more of a canine Olympics obstacle course.<br><br> 
			As I approached the Smiths' abode, I couldn't help but feel a sinking sensation in my stomach. Dodging drooling Great Danes and yapping Chihuahuas, I finally reached the front door—a beacon of hope in a sea of chaos. Or so I thought.<br><br> 
			Just as I was about to knock, a pair of eyes glinted in the dim light, followed by a menacing growl. There, standing between me and the safety of the Smiths' home, was the guardian of the gate—a Rottweiler of epic proportions, with a gaze that could curdle milk and a coat that was rough and scared.<br><br>
			Time seemed to stand still as the two of us locked eyes, I was frozen in fear and the Rottweiler poised to defend its territory. Then, with a sudden lunge, the Rottweiler made its move, pinning me against the door with a force that would make a linebacker proud.<br><br>
			I desperately fumbled to grab my clipboard from my <em>I Love Teaching</em> bag, using it as a makeshift shield against the onslaught of furry bodies that surrounded me, I heard a sound from within the house—a sound that sent shivers down my spine.<br><br>
			Out stepped Mrs. Smith, the matriarch of the family, dressed in a bathrobe that had seen better days, her hair still dripping wet and suds clinging to her scalp like stubborn barnacles.<br><br>
			"Ah, Miss Bihl!" she exclaimed, oblivious to the chaos unfolding on her doorstep. "So glad you could make it! Please, come in, come in. Mind the dogs, won't you?"<br><br>
			As I took a shaky breath I thought, sarcastically, to myself, <i>Why would I mind the dogs? Such sweet, cuddly things!</i> I stumbled into the safety of the Smiths' home on legs that felt more like jelly I left behind the muddy battlefield and the canine army that had nearly been my undoing, I couldn't help but wonder if I'd ever be able to look my trusty teacher clipboard the same way again.<br><br>
			<strong>Until next time stay calm and remember to always carry a clipboard</strong>
