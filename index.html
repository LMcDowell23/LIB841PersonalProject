			<p>For eighteen years I have worked in a rural school district that has a unique mix of farms, suburbs, and small city mentalities. When these kids come together hilarity ensues!<br><br> 
			Now, I will be the first to admit that not all the tales I share here were funny at the time. But are very funny, at least to me, now that I am removed from the situation. And I offer up this disclamer that I am retelling many of these events through the lens of a <strong>drama queen</strong>.<br><br> 
			I hope you enjoy my Daily Disasters in Education blog as much as I enjoy typing it!<br><br><br><br>
